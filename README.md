In the beginning there was nothing.
but i had to start here
cause it was where it all began


I can only see time as a singular moment that moves directly with me.  So how am i sure there was ever anything before or anything after, 
cause the concept of time suggests that everything is moving forward, like it started at one place and moved to another, while that may be 
true when you drive in a car or ride on a bike. I do not belive it to be true in this case. Time is more like an apple that has fallen 
from its tree, it looks great when it has first fallen, but as time goes on and it sit motionless it begins to turn brown and sour untill 
it has rotted away into nothing but a memory of its former glory.  But before the old goes on, it first creates, and leaves something in 
its place, and that, is what this story is all about.  Although nothing is as it were, there is still hope cause the creation of new 
experiences while they can be the darkest, most terrifing clash of moments you've ever seen, they can also be the warmest, most beautifuly 
intoxicating kiss given staight from an angel herself.   And with that i leave you with the rock that marked my journey and brought me 
down a path that i could have never known existed, a girl, cause there is always, a girl.
