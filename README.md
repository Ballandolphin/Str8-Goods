# Str8-Goods


In the beginning there was nothing.
but i had to start here
cause it was where it all began


I can only see time as a singular moment that moves directly with me.  So how am i sure there was ever anything before or anything after, 
cause the concept of time suggests that everything is moving forward, like it started at one place and moved to another, while that may be 
true when you drive in a car or ride on a bike. I do not belive it to be true in this case. Time is more like an apple that has fallen 
from its tree, it looks great when it has first fallen, but as time goes on and it sit motionless it begins to turn brown and sour untill 
it has rotted away into nothing but a memory of its former glory.  But before the old goes on, it first creates, and leaves something in 
its place, and that, is what this story is all about.  Although nothing is as it were, there is still hope cause the creation of new 
experiences while they can be the darkest, most terrifing clash of moments you've ever seen, they can also be the warmest, most beautifuly 
intoxicating kiss given staight from an angel herself.   And with that i leave you with the rock that marked my journey and brought me 
down a path that i could have never known existed, a girl, cause there is always, a girl.



Chapter 1 The spark
beeep.... beeep....beeep....beeep.... as i sat up i reached for my phone to stop the noise, i noticed how bright it was in my room. Damn im late again i yawned.  once again i went to bed late and drank to much the night before. it seemed to be a regular occurance.  one that i could do without.  It didnt really matter how late i was as long as i got to work before noon and stayed till the days work was done.  my boss was an old friend who happend to be a bigger alchaholic than me.  which definatly had its perks.   "i hate getting off late" i said to myself expecially tonight,  "WHAT" I heard coming from the hall.  my roommate was late too.  "NOTHING" I replied.  "YOU READY FOR TONIGHT" he yelled back at me.  it was friday and a friday that we had been waiting for all month. "YEA BUDDY, IM GONNA GET LAID TONIGHT" I hollered. we have been planning this party for over a month, and alex is determined to hook me up, he is my roommate and closest friend. its a long weekend and the guy who lives beside us is gone camping so we can keep the music playing well into the morning.  I could use a good party i hadent been very social since i had split up with my girlfriend almost a year ago now.  It was not that i wanted her back im the one who left her, it was just that i had lost hope that i would find someone who wouldnt be a huge waste of time, and end up breaking my heart one way or another.  My day was gonna be easy today so i wasnt in to much of a rush, had to go pick up paint and supplies at the shop and then go paint a fence.  I looked at my phone,  "o look alex" i said scooting across the room to show him my phone. I got a message and its from that girl i had been messaging with for a couple weeks now, "its Jessica she is going to be in town tonight and wants to know if she can stop in and check us out tonight" i basically screamed in his ear.  I was admitadly smiten with this girl, it was like she was out of a fairy tale. she had confidance, was always smiling, she actually made me think and that was rare. I seem to pick my girlfriends based on who will date me reather than an actuall connection. But this one had something about her that drew me in she was different, but in all the right ways.



My day was spent painting a couple boards then answering a couple messages. I cant believe how many people are going to make it over tonight i didnt even know i had this many friends. I couldnt stop thinking about Jessica, i was finnaly going to meet her.  she lived 3 hours away so it was not exactly easy to plan something when it would take 6 hours just to go for a coffee. As expected my day went by quick and smooth even when i had to stop every 15 minutes to tell someone that yes the party we have been planning all month is still gonna happen.I hope Alex has enough party favors to go around im going to have to get mine right away. jessica couldnt make it till later on so i needed to save some till she shows up.  I pulled up to the shop after work to find my boss sleeping on a lawn chair out front beer still in hand.  my truck startled him as i got close and he almost fell right off the chair.  "hey dont sneak up on a guy like that he grumbled as he got up and walked back into the shop.  he had a bit of an anger problem to say the least, one time i saw him yell at his fingers for being on his hands.  Drunk already Joey "dont you start on me now" he snapped his girlfriend must have shown up to the shop today. "You coming over tonight" i asked already knowing his answer.  "No i think im just gonna take it easy tonight" he automatically said. thats what he has said every time i have ever asked him to come out but once and that was only cause his girlfriend made him go out with the boys.  He got so drunk that night that he didnt even remember that he came over and that was the same night he yelled at his fingers.  I couldnt wait for tonight.  everything was all set i picked up the kegs the day before, i had my best clothes layed out on my bed, but i almost felt like i was forgetting something.
